With the release of TYPO3 Flow in 2011 and TYPO3 Neos in 2012, a both flexible and powerful platform was introduced as a possible successor for TYPO3 CMS. However, migration from TYPO3 CMS to TYPO3 Flow and Neos still presents a challenge due to large conceptual differences between the two systems.

This talk will show how the theoretical concepts (which I presented at an earlier talk at T3CONEU14) can be implemented in software to automate a lot of the necessary steps of a TYPO3-to-Flow migration and also present some real-world applications and experiences.
