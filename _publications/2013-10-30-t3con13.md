While Test-Driven Development (TDD) has already emerged as a widely accepted standard in agile software development over the past decade, the relatively young concept of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) tries to apply TDD principles to bridge the gap between developers and domain experts.

This talk aims at illustrating the basic principles of Behaviour Driven Development and will introduce appropriate tools that can be used for automated acceptance testing of web applications, like Cucumber, Behat and Mink.

The talk will include some real-life examples from Mittwald’s software development department. It will discuss the costs and benefits of BDD and how BDD can improve your software quality and ease both the developer’s and product owner’s mind.
