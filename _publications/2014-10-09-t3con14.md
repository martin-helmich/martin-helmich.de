With the release of TYPO3 Flow in 2011 and TYPO3 Neos in 2012, a both flexible and powerful platform was introduced as a possible successor for TYPO3 CMS. However, migration from TYPO3 CMS to TYPO3 Flow and Neos is still presents a challenge due to large conceptual differences between the two systems.

This talk aims at presenting an approach how a (semi) automated migration of TYPO3 CMS to TYPO3 Flow and Neos could be achieved.
