This book will take you on a journey into the world of microservices and cloud computing with the help of Go. It will start by covering the software architectural patterns of cloud applications, as well as practical concepts regarding how to scale, distribute, and deploy those applications. You will also learn how to build a JavaScript-based front-end for your application, using TypeScript and React. From there, we dive into commercial cloud offerings by covering AWS. Finally, we conclude our book by providing some overviews of other concepts and technologies that the reader can explore to move from where the book leaves off.
