When developing and administrating large-scale distributed applications, deployment and change management becomes a new challenge. Modern version control systems like Git and Continuous Integration platforms like Jenkins or Hudson help automating this process, thus making it more efficient and less error-prone.

This talk aims at presenting how these tools can be used to coordinate deployment processes among large teams in distributed, mission-critical infrastructure systems, and how this process can be supported using build tools (like Apache Ant) and test automation. A special focus of the talk will be on possibilities to integrate the deployment software TYPO3 Surf into Git/Jenkins architectures.
